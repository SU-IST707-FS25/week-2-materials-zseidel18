## Problem Breakdown

### Exercise 1 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part ex1-part1** (ex1-part1.answer): 4/5 points

_Feedback:_ Good understanding of EDA techniques. You mentioned distribution visualization and summary statistics for numeric data, and bar charts for categorical data. You also discussed comparing distributions for categorical-numeric relationships. Missing some specific techniques like box

**Part ex1-part2** (ex1-part2.code): 5/5 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You generated the data correctly and explored it using value counts, histograms, and boxplots, aligning with your prior work. The use of seaborn for visualization is a nice touch. Your approach effectively demonstrates EDA techniques.

### Exercise 2 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part 2-part1** (2-part1.code): 9/10 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You created a dataset with 1000 rows, 6 columns, and a target column using a noisy function. The numeric columns have different scales and ~5% nulls. The categorical column has 5 categories. Minor note: ensure the target is explicitly boolean.

### Exercise 3 (6/6 = 100.0%)

**Part ex2-part2** (ex2-part2.code): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You correctly used RandomForestClassifier with run_classifier and printed the results. The reflection on model performance is thoughtful. Your implementation aligns well with the instructions and your prior work.

**Part ex2-part3** (ex2-part3.answer): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ You correctly identified that Logistic Regression outperformed Random Forest due to the linear nature of the data generation process. Your explanation about noise and linearity is accurate and shows understanding of model behavior. Well done!
